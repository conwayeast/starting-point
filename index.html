    <p><span class="bold">Bold</span>, Regular &amp; <span class="italic">Italic</span> Paragraph Text</p>
      <p>What ever happened to predictability? The milkman, the paperboy, evening TV. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there's a heart, a hand to hold onto. <span class="bold">Everywhere you look, everywhere you go.</span> There's a face of somebody who needs you. Everywhere you look, when you're lost out there and you're all alone, a light is waiting to carry you home, Everywhere you look. Everywhere you look.</p>

      <p>Once in every lifetime, comes a love like this. Oh I need you, you need me, oh my darling can't you see. Young Ones. Darling we're the Young Ones. Young Ones. Shouldn't be afraid. To live, love, there's a song to be sung. Cause we may not be the Young Ones very long.</p>

      <p>This is it, this is it. This is life, the one you get, so go and have a ball. This is it, this is it. Straight ahead, and rest assured you can't be sure at all. <span class="italic">So while you're here enjoy the view, keep on doing what you do, so hold on tight we'll muddle through one day at a time, one day at a time.</span> So up on your feet, up on your feet - somewhere there's music playing. Don't you worry none, we'll just take it like it comes, one day at a time, one day at a time.</p>

      <p>People let me tell you 'bout my best friend, he's a warm-hearted person who’ll love me till the end. People let me tell you 'bout my best friend, he's a one boy cuddly toy, my up, my down, my pride and joy. People let me tell you 'bout him he's so much fun whether we’re talkin' man to man or whether we’re talking son to son. Cause he’s my best friend. Yes he's my best friend.</p>

      <p>Now, the world don't move to the beat of just one drum, what might be right for you, may not be right for some. A man is born, he's a man of means. Then along come two, they got nothing but their jeans. But they got, Diff'rent Strokes, it takes Diff'rent Strokes. It takes Diff'rent Strokes to move the world.</p>


    <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
      <p>Single line blockquote:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:</p>
      <blockquote><p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. </p></blockquote>
